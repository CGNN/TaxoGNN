44974	Abstract	2	it was expected that deficits in object relations theory and to a lesser degree reality testing would be exhibited by the group as a whole and that they would be related to the presence of comorbid disorders	80205471:6:8, 2780408722:14:15

59372	Abstract	1	recombinant antithrombin produced by baby hamster kidney cell bhk or chinese hamster ovary cell chinese hamster ovary cell was separated into two fractions containing comparable amounts of protein by affinity chromatography on matrix linked heparin	179247698:29:30, 33263850:4:7, 175656101:10:13, 175656101:14:17, 175656101:10:13, 175656101:14:17, 2777557582:34:34, 137127113:32:32, 2910447009:0:1
59372	Abstract	2	fluorescence titration showed that the more tightly binding fraction had a heparin affinity similar to that of plasma antithrombin kd approximately 20 nm whereas the affinity of the more weakly binding fraction was nearly 10 fold lower kd approximately 175 nm	2779026020:18:18, 91881484:0:0, 2777557582:11:11, 82706917:17:17, 184866935:1:1
59372	Abstract	3	analyses of the heparin catalysed rate of inhibition of thrombin further showed that the fractions differed only in their affinity for heparin and not in the intrinsic value reaction rate constant of either the uncatalysed or the heparin catalysed inactivation of thrombin	2777557582:3:3, 2777557582:21:21, 2777557582:37:37, 185994504:26:27, 93391505:28:30, 2777292125:9:9, 2777292125:41:41
59372	Abstract	4	the recombinant antithrombin fraction with lower heparin affinity migrated more slowly than both the fraction with higher affinity and plasma antithrombin in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions consistent with a slightly higher apparent molecular mass	2779026020:2:2, 2779026020:20:20, 2777557582:6:6, 82706917:19:19, 2910447009:1:2, 58121356:34:35, 101660505:22:24
59372	Abstract	5	this apparent size difference was abolished by the enzymic removal of the carbohydrate side chain from the proteins	2911159403:1:2, 2778977261:12:12, 204921945:13:14
59372	Abstract	6	such removal also increased the heparin affinity of the weakly binding fraction so that it elution from matrix linked heparin at a similar position to the deglycosylated tightly binding fraction or plasma antithrombin	2779026020:32:32, 73826308:15:15, 2777557582:5:5, 2777557582:19:19, 137127113:17:17, 82706917:31:31

59372	Abstract	8	we conclude that the recombinant antithrombin produced by the two cell culture is heterogeneously glycosylated and that the increased carbohydrate content of a large proportion of the molecule results in a substantial decrease in the affinity of these molecule for heparin	81885089:10:11, 2777557582:40:40, 2909175661:18:19, 32909587:27:27, 32909587:38:38, 2910447009:4:5

138491	Abstract	1	gallbladder agenesis is a rare condition that results from the failure of the cystic bud to develop in the 4th wk of intrauterine life	2908998021:0:1
138491	Abstract	2	agenesis is usually discovered at laparotomy for cholecystectomy since ultrasound examination of a patient with suggestive symptoms not visualizing the gallbladder is compatibility with chronic cholecystitis shrunken gallbladder	2777943302:0:0, 2776641081:7:7, 2994355339:24:25, 93428437:22:22, 2777148285:20:20, 2777148285:27:27, 2780778865:5:5, 143753070:9:9
138491	Abstract	3	the surgeon must prove agenesis by thoroughly examining the most common sites for ectopic gallbladders and by performing intraoperative cholangiograms	2777943302:4:4

165226	Title	0	healing erosive esophagitis with a proton pump inhibitor the more the merrier	2909212255:1:2, 2781025758:5:7
165226	Abstract	1	patients with erosive esophagitis ee account for 30 of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease only a minority of these patients fail to achieve healing on treatment with a proton pump inhibitor ppi once daily for 8 weeks	2779134260:13:13, 2909212255:2:3, 3019878914:32:33, 2781025758:28:30, 43270747:12:12
165226	Abstract	2	for those patients with ee who have failed to heal on a ppi given once daily current practice is to double the ppi dose although there is little published evidence to support this	3019585708:16:17, 3019878914:14:15
165226	Abstract	3	in this issue of the american journal of gastroenterology authors from japan have demonstrated that double dose ppi produced higher healing rates when given as a split twice daily dose than as a once daily dose for patients with ee who had failed initial therapy with rabeprazole 10 mg once daily	2991723067:15:16, 90924648:8:8, 3020629751:43:44, 3019878914:33:34, 3019878914:49:50, 2779116819:46:46
165226	Abstract	4	quadruple dose ppi given as a split dose did not increase the healing rates but did produce better symptom control albeit limited compared with double dose ppi given twice daily	2991723067:24:25, 3018920108:6:7, 3020256335:18:19
165226	Abstract	5	because subjects initially received a lower ppi dose than that generally indicated for ee rabeprazole 20 mg daily this study does not provide the eagerly awaited justification for double dose ppi therapy in patient with ee who have failed standard dose ppi once daily	2991723067:28:29, 3018028166:32:33, 3019878914:42:43, 2779116819:14:14
165226	Abstract	6	however it does demonstrate the clinical advantage of a split dose regimen am and pm compared with a once daily regimen when doubling the dose of a ppi for patients with residual ee after initial therapy	3020629751:34:35, 3019878914:18:19, 2781413609:11:11, 2781413609:20:20, 155512373:31:31, 3018920108:9:10

171003	Abstract	1	purpose	
171003	Abstract	2	it has been reported that fixation conditions significantly influence the apparent pore density in the inner wall endothelium of schlemm s canal	2776992346:17:17, 98516739:5:5, 2780186721:19:21
171003	Abstract	3	in the present study the manner in which fixation conditions affect the two subtypes of inner wall pores intracellular pores and intracellular or border pores was investigated	98516739:8:8, 79879829:18:18, 79879829:21:21, 79879829:18:18, 79879829:21:21
171003	Abstract	4	methods outflow facility was measured in enucleated human eyes	86132830:1:1
171003	Abstract	5	eyes were fixed under constant flow or constant pressure conditions microdissected to expose the inner wall of schlemm s canal and prepared for scanning electron microscope	2993103352:4:5, 2993677520:7:8, 2779137570:12:12, 26771246:23:25, 2780186721:17:19
171003	Abstract	6	the density and diameter of the two subtypes of pores in the inner wall were measured	
171003	Abstract	7	results intracellular pore density decreased with increasing postmortem time p 0 25 and p 0 15 respectively	79879829:1:1
171003	Abstract	8	border pore density increased with increasing fixation pressure p 0 4	98516739:6:6
171003	Abstract	9	no correlation was found between outflow facility and the predictions of hagen poiseuille equation s law sampson s law or the funneling theory for the hydraulic conductivity of the intracellular pores p 0 35 or the border pores p 0 1	117220453:1:1, 63184880:25:26, 79879829:29:29, 199539241:15:15, 199539241:18:18, 86132830:5:5, 175336444:11:13
171003	Abstract	10	conclusions	
171003	Abstract	11	the intracellular and border pores form two morphologically and functionally distinct populations in the inner wall of schlemm s canal	79879829:1:1, 2780186721:17:19
171003	Abstract	12	the dependence of intracellular pore density on postmortem time and on volume of fixative passed through the outflow pathway suggests that these pores are artifacts of fixation or processing conditions	2780848204:13:13, 79879829:3:3, 86132830:17:17, 98516739:26:26
171003	Abstract	13	that border pores do not depend on such conditions and that their presence is correlative with perfusion suggests that this population may be nonartifactual	2776800370:14:14, 146957229:16:16, 2908647359:20:20
171003	Abstract	14	new histologic techniques for examining the inner wall of schlemm s canal are necessary to determine the in vivo state of inner wall pores and how they influence outflow facility	207001950:17:18, 86132830:28:28, 2780186721:9:11
